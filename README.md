My code is ONLY the android client part

Students laboratory android project. Could be used as a client-server quiz application.

Use-case:

1. Android client recieves messages with questions from server
2. User picks the answer and android client sends this information back to server
3. Server returns the correct answer
4. At the end the server sends "finish" message to the client and final activity with the results is displayed
